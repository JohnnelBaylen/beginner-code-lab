Stacks :  
    -   A stack is a data structure that can hold many elements, and 
        the last element added is the first one to be removed.

    -   Like a pile of pancakes, the pancakes are both added and removed from the top.
        So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last pancake you added. 
        This way of organizing elements is called LIFO: Last In First Out.

Basic operations : 

  -  Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
  -  Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
  -  Peek: Returns the top (last) element on the stack.
  -  isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
  -  Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.


-   Stacks can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists.
-   Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms, to revert to previous states, to create algorithms for depth-first search in graphs, or for backtracking.
-   Stacks are often mentioned together with Queues, which is a similar data structure described on the next page.
